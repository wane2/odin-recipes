            <li>Melt the butter in a double-broiler, add the cannabis, and cook for 2-3 hours, stirring every 15 minutes.</li>

            <li>Refrigerate, so the butter hardens and cools.</li>
            <li>Before use, you can melt the butter and strain it through a cheesecloth once more to rid it of all impurities.</li>
            <li>Set the oven to preheat to 350째F/175째C and line a 9x13-inch(23x33 cm) pan with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Sift the all-purpose flour, the baking soda, and the salt into a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Cream the cannabutter and the brown sugar until fluffy, then add the eggs one by one, beating after each addition.</li>
            <li>Whisk in the melted chocolate and the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Now, first, whisk in the half of the sour cream and the flour into the cannabutter mixture, then whisk in the other half.</li>
            <li>Lastly, stir in the boiling water.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into a pan, taking care that it is spread evenly.</li>
            <li>Bake in a preheated oven for 35 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once done, wait for the cake to cool for 10 minutes. Ice if desired, and then serve.</li>
